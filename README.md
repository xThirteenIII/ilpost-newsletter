# ilpost-newsletter

Since I always miss the newsletters i've subscribed to from `www.ilpost.it`, too lazy to read them from my phone on the email,
this tool runs as a daemon on my arch and executes each day at 10 am.
It downloads the html, parse the text content into an .md file, and moves it to my desired directory on my pc.
This way i can read lol
